# Horizon | Scrolling Navigation

This project showcases a **responsive web page** designed for intuitive **horizontal scrolling navigation**, especially on mobile devices in **portrait mode**. It features a clean, simple layout where content sections are laid out side-by-side. As you scroll, sections **snap precisely into view**, creating a smooth and user-friendly experience. Upon loading, particularly on upright devices, the "Search" section automatically centers itself for immediate access.

Built with standard web technologies (HTML, CSS, and a touch of JavaScript), this solution uses a flexible layout to arrange content horizontally and applies specific styling to enable efficient scrolling and snapping when your device is held in portrait orientation. A small script ensures that the "Search" section is the first thing you see.

To experience this, simply save the provided HTML code as an `.html` file and open it in any modern web browser. Try resizing your browser or viewing it on a mobile device to see how it adapts and the horizontal scrolling comes to life in portrait mode.
